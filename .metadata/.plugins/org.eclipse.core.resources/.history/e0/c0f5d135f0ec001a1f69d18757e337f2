   byte -  8-bit signed two's complement integer
   			minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive)
   short - you can use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters
   int - is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1
   			represent an unsigned 32-bit integer,
   			represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1.
   long - is a 64-bit two's complement integer.
   			represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1
   float -  This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. 
   			For that, you will need to use the java.math.BigDecimal class instead. Numbers and Strings covers BigDecimal and other useful classes provided by the Java platform.
